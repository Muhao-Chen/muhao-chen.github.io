## Research Goal
The existing design approaches mainly deal with what is sufficient rather than necessary, locked into the classical thinking of component technology. That is, design the structure first, followed by material studies and fluid analysis, and add control and signal processing later. The critical question that we ask is whether dramatic performance improvements are possible by combining different disciplines as a communal pool of resources such that engineers in different disciplines have more freedom and can talk to each other in the design space to solve a joint optimization problem. Our research aims to exploit the integration of disciplines for better performance with fewer resources required of various engineering systems.  


We would also like to develop and offer more and more software and tools to help engineers knit efficient structures that physics and their imagination allow and motivate students to study structure and control more fundamentally. All the source codes can be found on the [Software](https://muhao-chen.github.io/resources/) page.

## Research Interests

-----
### Integrating Structure & Control Design    
* Objective: Using the least amount of resources (structure mass, damper, control energy, sensors & actuators, and computational efforts) to achieve the required performance (stiffness, control objective, accuracy bound, safety and redundancy, and robustness)   
* Critical problems: Nonlinear and linearized dynamics and control, resource allocation algorithms, theories of integrated disciplines  

### Robotics & Lightweight automated system (i.e., by tensegrity, origami)
* Design: Lightweight structure design, deployment planning, actuation, and sensing strategy 
* Control: Data-based & model-based nonlinear and linear control, covariance control, obstacle avoidance, and path planning
* Signal processing: optimal sensor & actuator selection algorithm for nonlinear and linear systems, optimal simulation model, finite precision simulation


### Tensegrity and Origami Systems
* Tensergity and Origami solutions to the five fundamental problems in engineering mechanics: compression, tension, torsion, cantilever, simply supported
* Statics: Form-finding algorithms, structure topology optimization, minimal mass design subject to local and global failures
* Dynamics: The dynamics of the pure bar-string network, clustered tensegrity, origami, and tensegrity with arbitrary objects (non-rigid and rigid bodies)
* Applications: Wings and hydrofoils, space habitats, lunar towers, cable domes, robotic dolphins, robotic grippers, etc.

### Dynamical and Control Theory
* Data-driven control, path planning, finite bit computing of high-dimensional (FEM/FSI) systems
* Multibody dynamics, rigid and non-rigid body, nonlinear and linearized dynamics with arbitrary shape objects, and modal analysis      
* Structure redundancy, uncertainty, and robustness, FSI dynamics 
* Fluid-structure dynamics, structure under extreme fluid loading conditions, biomimetic structure designs, soft actuation strategy, and control
* Applications: rescue shelters, fish and hydrofoils, etc.

### Space Systems
* Lightweight and deployable structure solutions for the deep space explorations    
* Applications: space habitat design, Moon & Mars towers, drilling rigs, antennas, etc.

<!--A misconception is that "The best system is made from the best components." That is certainly not true. Often, we gain more in integrating two disciplines than in making exceptional improvements in one discipline. For example, aerodynamics engineers first designed the best shape in the airplane wing based on their knowledge of fluid dynamics. The control engineer came and broke the beautiful shape for control objectives. This is certainly not the right way. A systematic approach would be to modify the shape not by pushing against a reference equilibrium but by modifying the equilibrium. Of course, this would require much less control effort. -->
