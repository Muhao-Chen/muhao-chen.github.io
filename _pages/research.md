A misconception is that “The best system is made from the best components”. That is certainly not true. Often, we gain more in integrating two disciplines than making exceptional improvements in one discipline. For example, in the airplane wing, aerodynamics engineers first designed the best
shape based on their knowledge in fluid dynamics, then the control engineer came and break the beautiful shape for control objectives. This is certainly not the right way. A systematic approach would be to modify shape not by pushing against a reference equilibrium but by modifying the 
equilibrium. Of course, this would require much less control effort.

# Research Topics

The existing design approaches mainly deal with what is sufficient rather than necessary, locked into the classical thinking of component technology. That is, design the structure first, followed by material studies and fluid analysis, and add control and signal processing later. The critical question that we ask is that whether dramatic performance improvements are possible by combining different disciplines as a communal pool of resources such that engineers in different disciplines have more freedom and can talk to each other in the design space to solve a joint optimization problem. My research aims to exploit the integration of disciplines for better performance with fewer resources required of various engineering systems.

### Radio Frequency Fingerprint (RFF) Identification
All the components of wireless devices will have slightly different features, e.g., the carrier frequency of the oscillators, from the manufacturing processing. Similar to a biometric fingerprint, these characteristics are unique and permanent, which can act as the fingerprint of the devices. This technique first requires collecting the device fingerprint and storing them in a database and then classifying devices by comparing them with the stored database whenever a device wishes to join the network.
