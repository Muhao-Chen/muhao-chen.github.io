A misconception is that “The best system is made from the best components.” That is certainly not true. Often, we gain more in integrating two disciplines than making exceptional improvements in one discipline. For example, in the airplane wing, aerodynamics engineers first designed the best
shape based on their knowledge in fluid dynamics, then the control engineer came and broke the beautiful shape for control objectives. This is certainly not the right way. A systematic approach would be to modify shape not by pushing against a reference equilibrium but by modifying the 
equilibrium. Of course, this would require much less control effort.

## Research Topics

The existing design approaches mainly deal with what is sufficient rather than necessary, locked into the classical thinking of component technology. That is, design the structure first, followed by material studies and fluid analysis, and add control and signal processing later. The critical question that we ask is that whether dramatic performance improvements are possible by combining different disciplines as a communal pool of resources such that engineers in different disciplines have more freedom and can talk to each other in the design space to solve a joint optimization problem. My research aims to exploit the integration of disciplines for better performance with fewer resources required of various engineering systems.

### Integrating Structure & Control Design    
* Objective: Using the least amount of resources (structure mass, damper, control energy, cost of sensors & actuators, and computational efforts) to achieve the required performance (stiffness, control accuracy, redundancy, and robustness)
* Critical problems: Nonlinear and linear structure dynamics and control, fluid-structure interaction (FSI), resource allocation algorithms, the integrated disciplines by solving LMIs (linear matrix inequality)

### Robotics
* Design: Lightweight structure design, deployment planning, actuation strategy 
* Control: Data-based & model-based nonlinear and linear control, covariance control, obstacle avoidance, and path planning
* Signal processing: optimal sensor & actuator selection algorithm for nonlinear and linear systems, optimal simulation model


### Tensegrity Systems
* Tensergity solutions to the five fundamental problems in engineering mechanics: compression, tension, torsion, cantilever, simply supported
* Statics: Form-finding algorithms, structure topology optimization,  minimal mass design subject to local and global failures
* Dynamics: The dynamics of the pure bar-string network, clustered tensegrity, and tensegrity with arbitrary objects (non-rigid and rigid bodies)
* Applications: Wings and hydrofoils, space habitat, lunar towers, cable domes, robotic dolphins, robotic grippers, etc.

### Dynamical Systems Theory
* Multibody dynamics, rigid and non-rigid body nonlinear and linearized dynamics, and modal analysis      
* Structure redundancy, uncertainty, and robustness, FSI dynamics 


### Space Systems

### Space Habitat Design

### Fluid-Structure Interaction
* Biommic structure design
* Fluid-structure dynamics, 
* actuation strategy and control
* Applications: cheap shelters, fish and hydrofoils, etc.

## Research Demonstration
We are always keen to apply our knowledge to practical applications. Hence we have created several demonstration videos to present our applied research.
