<!-- ## Tensegrity Lab -->
<!-- , integrated with signal processing resource design.  -->
<!-- rewrite -->
<!-- Tensegrity Lab seeks to develop new analytical tools to merge structure and control design with material science to create new structures and material systems. The structural paradigm for this research is tensegrity systems, creating minimal mass systems that allow minimal control energy within the constraints of allowable computational and sensing/actuating resources. The lab builds physical demonstrations of this integrated system design philosophy with material science to create new material systems. Robots are designed to deploy from small stowed packages. Robots are designed to harvest rocks and regolith from asteroids or the moon. Tensegrity structures are designed for deployment in space. Tensegrity Robots are designed to build tensegrity structures in space autonomously. Wings are designed without hinged surfaces to controllable shapes. Antennas are designed for deployment in space within operational accuracies. Impact tensegrity structures are designed to protect payloads at the impact on the moon or Mars. These studies employ data-based as well as model-based control methods. -->
<!-- : Structures, Dynamics, and Controls. Each area aims for optimal performance using minimal resources—including mass, dampers, sensors, actuators, computational cost, and control energy—according to specific loading and control requirements -->

<!-- The Space Structures, Dynamics, and Control (SSDC) Lab focuses on three primary areas: *Structures*: We design lightweight, deployable structures essential for space systems to minimize launch costs and payload volume. *Dynamics*: We focus on precise, cost-effective modeling, both model- and data-based, to optimally analyze multi-body dynamical systems. *Controls*: Our strategy includes advanced control techniques for deployable structures and robots. Passive control stabilizes structures against disturbances and uncertainties, while active control focuses on robust and precise control laws and path planning to reduce control energy and sensor and actuator costs while maintaining performance. -->
My research focuses on three primary areas: Dynamics: Focus on precise, cost-effective modeling, both model- and data-based, to optimally analyze multi-body dynamical systems. Controls: Study advanced control techniques for deployable multi-body dynamical systems and robots. Passive control stabilizes dynamical systems against disturbances and uncertainties, while active control focuses on robust and precise control laws and path planning to reduce control energy and sensor and actuator costs while maintaining performance. Aerospace Systems: Design lightweight, deployable, automated aerospace systems to minimize costs and volume.
