I am affiliated to the Advanced Networks Research Group at University of Liverpool. Our group has six academic staff and has strong expertise in the area of wireless communication, wireless security, trust, information theory, artificial intelligence applications in communications, signal processing for communications, 5G, embedded system designs. We very welcome research collaborations and visits.

I am always looking for excellent and highly-motivated PhD students, post-doc, and visiting researchers. All our research involves exploiting the wireless channels for innovative applications. The three topics that I am particularly interested are
* [Key generation from wireless channels](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/research-area/keygen/){:target="_blank"}
* [Radio frequency fingerprinting identification](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/research-area/rffi/){:target="_blank"}
* Device free wireless sensing

I am also very keen to explore new areas.

If you are interested, please drop me an email (junqing.zhang at liverpool.ac.uk) with your CV.

# China Scholarship Council for PhD Students 
We are proud to be the partner of the CSC scholarship. This is a very generous scholarship which provides full financial support. In particular, our university will waive the international tuition fee and CSC will provide the living allowance.

The application will open every year around October. Please note this is a two-step application. 
* Step 1: You should submit a full application (in English) to our university first. You have to get a unconditional offer before you place a CSC application to our university. The deadline for this step is usually in the middle of January. 
* Step 2: If you are successful at step 1, you will then submit another full application (in Chinese) to the CSC in China. The deadline is usually in the middle of March. The result is usually announced in May.
If you are successful in both steps, you will be awarded the full scholarship from our University and CSC.
