Please find a list of the final year projects that I am supervising or have supervised. Students are also welcome to propose their own projects.

The final year projects that I am supervising usually 
* Use embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi, Arduino, FPGA, and [software defined radio platforms](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2019/07/blog-post-sdr/) 
* Build wireless applications, such as IoT, security, and sensing
* Involve wireless technologies including [WiFi](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2019/05/blog-post-wifi/), [LoRa/LoRaWAN](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2019/12/blog-post-lora-lorawan/), [ZigBee](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2020/11/blog-post-zigbee/), and [Bluetooth](https://junqing-zhang.github.io/posts/2020/09/blog-post-bluetooth/);
* Require strong programming skills such as Python, C/C++, Matlab
* Involve machine learning and deep learning
