This page summarizes information for Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP).


# Introduction
USRP has different series, including network series, bus series, embedded series. A selection guide is given in [https://kb.ettus.com/Selecting_an_USRP_Device](https://kb.ettus.com/Selecting_an_USRP_Device){:target="_blank"}

Some USRP series do not have RF capabilities, e.g., the N210 USRP. A separate RF daughterboard will be required.
* RF Daughterboard Selection: Not all the USRP is equpped with the RF card, including N and X series. A selection guide is provided at [https://kb.ettus.com/Selecting_an_RF_Daughterboard](https://kb.ettus.com/Selecting_an_RF_Daughterboard){:target="_blank"}

# Installation of GNURadio and UHD
It is strongly recommended to use pybombs to install gnuradio and UHD in Ubuntu. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.gnuradio.org/blog/2016-06-19-pybombs-the-what-the-how-and-the-why/){:target="_blank"}
